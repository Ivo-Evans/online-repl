This is a client-side JavaScript repl made, really, as a proof of concept. It resembles other online services, like the repl at repl.it/languages/javascript.

One day I may embed it or code like it into educational resources.

I didn't build my own JavaScript compiler out of JavaScript (obviously) - it uses the JavaScript compiler in the browser. This means that it's dangerous, and you should be extremely wary of putting this code near sensitive data of any kind. I am running the code serverless.
