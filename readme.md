This is a client-side JavaScript repl made as a proof of concept. It resembles other online services, like the repl at repl.it/languages/javascript.

I didn't build my own JavaScript compiler out of JavaScript (obviously) - it uses the JavaScript compiler in the browser. This means that it's dangerous, and you should be extremely wary of putting this code near sensitive data of any kind. I am running it serverless.
